#### Core Framework

The Auron Labs production system operates on a streamlined multi-agent architecture, featuring specialised AI agents coordinated by a central Director Agent. This framework leverages AI video generation models (Veo 3 and Kling 2.1) while ensuring seamless collaboration, maintaining creative vision consistency, and delivering professional-grade animated content with robust continuity management.

#### Continuity Solution

Advanced tracking and management systems specifically designed for AI video generation ensure seamless continuity across scenes generated by Veo 3 and Kling 2.1 models. The Continuity Management Agent eliminates common AI video generation issues through sophisticated cross-reference algorithms, consistency enforcement, and real-time monitoring of character, environmental, and narrative coherence between AI-generated scenes.
