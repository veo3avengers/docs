**Hierarchical Command Structure**

Auron Labs central AI Director maintains executive control over all agents through a structured command hierarchy. Commands flow from the Director to specialized agents, while feedback and status updates flow back through defined channels.

#### Data Sharing Protocols

All agents share standardized data formats to ensure seamless integration:

- **Asset Format Standards:** Universal 3D model, texture, and animation formats
- **Metadata Protocols:** Consistent tagging and categorization systems
- **Version Control:** Automated asset versioning and change tracking
- **Real-time Synchronization:** Live data sharing for collaborative work

#### Feedback Loops

Continuous feedback mechanisms ensure quality and consistency:

- **Quality Gates:** Mandatory checkpoints for approval before progression
- **Cross-validation:** Agents validate each other's work for consistency
- **Human Oversight:** Artist input integrated at key decision points
- **Iterative Refinement:** Continuous improvement based on feedback
